            <p>
                I have always had a passion for technology ever since my father brought home our very first IBM desktop. In no time, family and relatives would start to come to me for troubleshooting help and advice for their technology. From making a Wifi connection and figuring out why the printer won't work to recovering a machine riddled with viruses, I have always been the go-to person for these requests.

                I especially have a passion for the video game industry and aspire to eventually become a game designer. I pay attention to what a game expects from a user rather than just what a user expects from a game. I would like to have the time and resources to make some of the visions of games in my head turn into a reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to playing games as a hobby, I have experience in implementing multiple casual games from scratch in my spare time while learning programming languages. I have experience developing games on all sorts of mediums ranging from FPGA's to the Unity engine. I hope to one day be able to focus my time and energy on making something with quality that I design, considering current trends and how to stick out from the competition. I know what the average player wants as well as what will sell. I constantly pay attention to and have genuine interest in what is trending. I would be an asset to any organization of people in the industry, big or small.
